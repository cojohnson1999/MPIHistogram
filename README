3.) Usage for tempReadings.c is as follows:

      ./tempReadings [N] >> [temps_file]

    This program generates N numbers to a file temps_file when run
    with this command.



4.) Usage for mpiHistogram.c is as follows:

      mpiexec -n [num_procs] ./hist [data_count] < [data_file] >> [histogram_file]

    This program takes num_procs processes and generates a histogram of 
    data_count numbers from the file data_file and generates a table of
    information in histogram_file about the distribution of the numbers
    in the different bins.


    Issues with Program:

      This program works with no errors for any input file with a data_count
      value < 122.  This will output a histogram graph with no additional 
      errors or output.

      However, any value of data_count >= 122 will result in MPI throwing 
      a segmentation fault on one of its processes (likely due to a memory
      issue).  This results in numerous different errors which change for
      different file sizes of data_file and different requested amounts of 
      values for data_count.

      Errors range as follows:

        Requesting a histogram of data_count = (122 <= 2090) will result in 
        MPI throwing either an error of "munmap_chunk(): invalid pointer",
        "free(): invalid size", or "double free or corruption (out)" and the
        segmentation fault message WHILE STILL PRODUCING THE HISTOGRAM TABLE 
        (tested with a data_file of 1000 numbers).

        Data_file sizes above 10000 cause ONLY the segmentation fault to output
        if the requested value of data_count is > 2090.

        This unexpected behavior has been documented to the best of my ability,
        but other errors may occur when data_count and data_file are in the 
        thousands.
